# FootyForecast ⚽📊  
A Machine Learning-based Football Match Outcome Prediction System

## 📌 Overview  
FootyForecast is an intelligent football match predictor built using machine learning. It forecasts match outcomes—Home Win, Draw, or Away Win—by analyzing historical match stats, betting odds, and team form. The model is robust, scalable, and ready to integrate into sports platforms or front-end dashboards.
